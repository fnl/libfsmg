/**
 * Transitions define how elements of a sequence should match to the pattern.
 * <p>
 * E.g., if the {@link Pattern} (NFA) should match a List of elements of some generic type
 * <code>E</code> (i.e., a <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> ), transition instances determine if the
 * current element in the sequence being aligned is appropriate to allow the automaton to move on
 * (transition) to its next state.
 * <p>
 * In the case of a character sequence automaton (i.e., in String pattern matching such as provided
 * by Java's regex package), the {@link Transition#matches(Object)} implementation would return the
 * Boolean result of {@link Character#compareTo(Character)} <code>== 0</code> and be instantiated
 * by defining the relevant character for the transition. Furthermore, for the backtracking
 * mechanism provided by the {@link Pattern} NFA, a {@link #weight() weight} for each transition
 * must be defined, while epsilon transitions should default to a weight of zero. The path chosen
 * for backtracking then is the path that has the highest summed transition weights and therefore
 * identifies the matched sequence and capture groups.
 *

 *   public boolean matches(Character other) {
